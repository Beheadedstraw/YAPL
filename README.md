# YAPL
Yet Another Programming Language

YAPL was created purely out of boredom and a few beers. I wanted something that was pretty simple and in a coding format most people would recognize (YAML).

Currently it does the basic things, takes input, stores variables, prints static strings and/or variables, the extremely buggy beginnings of a loop and if/else function along with general math equations.

What I'm hoping to get done is:
* fix the if/else so it works with things other than integers
* flesh out the loop a bit more
* maybe, possibly, implement some exception handling and actually let the user know where the hell they went wrong.
* Documentation. God I hate writing documentation.

# There's currently zero exception handling right now and little to no error feedback besides Python crash dumps.
